-   I learned that external calls revert and bubble up but low level calls (`CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `STATICCALL`) just return a boolean don't bubble up resulting in revert.
-   I learned that on every external call only 63/64 of gas available is passed down so that if there is a revert it can bubble up and be handled (maybe using try catch).
-   I learned that if a function takes 2 functions as arguments there is no way to know which function of those 2 will be executed first.

-   I learned about better self-custody, basically setting a Safe where the signers are my Metamask, Rainbow and Ledger wallet. Combining all three for max security!

-   I learned about [Delegatable](https://delegatable.org/) protocol which is about delegation off-chain and having effects later on-chain. (learning more about picked it up late night)
