Added a day late.

-   I learned how Ethernaut works, how it creates new instances for every player and how the validation of where the player has cleared the level or not is separated into Individual Level Factory contracts.
-   On top of that Ethernaut also has a `Statistics` contract which keeps count of failed attempts, how many players cleared what levels, instances created, players etc...
