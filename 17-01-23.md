-   I learned about how Proxy should be properly initialized, initialization should be only once and shouldn't be possible again
-   I learned how delegatecall to a contract which does `selfdestruct` destroys the caller.
-   I learned some earlier version of Solidity allowed constructors to be payable even though they didn't have the payable keyword.
-   I learned about the Minimal Proxy EIP-1167, which is basically the smallest version clone you can deploy which forwards DelegateCall's to a user specified address in the bytecode.
-   I learned that we shouldn't use strict equalities atleast not in types like `int` and `uint`.
-   I learned that critical address change should be 2 step process
    -   Step 1: First store the address
    -   Step 2: Change the owner to the newOwner.
