-   I learned that `receive` function is called when someone send Ether to the contract and there is no data, `fallback` is called when there is data but no matching function signature.
-   `fallback` is also called when there is no data and no `receive` function. `fallback` is the last resort, there is no fallback for `fallback`.
-   Contract cannot react to Ether sent via `selfdestruct` or `coinbase` transaction. So keeping a count of balance is not a good idea, since the counter won't be increment in these cases.
-   Both `fallback` and `receive` have a limitation of 2300 gas.
-   `[address].transfer` reverts on failure and does not return anything on success, whereas `[address].send` returns a boolean on failure or success and does not revert if the transfer of Ether fails!
-   Memory arrays are fixed, they don't have the `push` member to change the size.
