-   I learned about various auditing tools like Karl, Fuzzing-as-a-service by Openzeppelin, Scribble language.
-   Karl basically looks out for new contract deployments and trying to find in vulnerabilities in them.
-   Fuzzing-as-a-service is where you can send contracts to be exploited by variations of input, you need to annotate functions with assumption or constraints using Scribble langauage and the fuzzer tries to break them!
