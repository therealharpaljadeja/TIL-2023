-   I learned about new pragma directives like `Abicoder` and experimental `SMTChecker`.
-   Abicoder v2 can encode and decode arbitarily nested arrays & structs. Abicoder v2 is by default on.
-   `SMTChecker` checks for various conditions for example:- possibility for Overflow / Underflow. Also, assumes the require statements as true and if there are any assert statements later in the function then checks if they are always true, unreachable code, out of bounds access, insufficient funds transfer etc...
-   I learned about a new NatSpec tag `@custom:` which can be used for anything that is not covered by the other tags.
-   I learned that `constant` variable need to be initialized along with declaration just like JS.
-   I learned that `immutable` variable are supposed to be initialized in the constructor.
-   One difference between constant and immutable is that `constant` variable can be expression and that entire expression is replaced where the constant is used not the evalution result, this is why `constant` cannot be an expression which has any environment variable (msg.sender, msg.value, block.number etc...) but something that is eventually also constant.
-   Both `immutable` and `constant` don't require a slot.
