-   I learned about the Broken window principle, it says a single broken window is enough to initiate the demonlition of a building. Similarly, a few lines of broken, sloppy code induces a feeling of not caring among the maintainers of the code.
-   Basically, everyone thinking let it be as is until nothing breaks!
-   The mitigation to this is basically fixing it as soon as possible, or atleast bring it to the spotlight.

-   I learned about the Boiling Frog problem, it goes as follows if you put a frog in a pan containing boiling water it will immediately out. But if you put the frog in a pan containing water and slowly increase the temperature it will hold still until it dies.
-   Moral of the story, keep an eye on the critical parts and make sure that you know the reason behind the change and the environment. Basically do a timely broad view check, don't wait for the water to reach the boiling point.

-   I learned about the Stone Soup story, it goes as follows Three solidiers arrive at a village after war days. They were hungry and arrived at the village with the expectation that the villagers will provide food turns out most of the food supplies were exhausted because of the war. All doors and windows were shut, nobody offered food.
-   The solidiers boiled up some water and put 3 stones in it, a villager noticed and asked is that enough to make soup? The soldiers replied it can be better if we can get carrots!
-   The villager immediately went on search for carrots and brought some, similarly villagers came by and asked is it enough? The soldiers kept on replying with food items that can make the soup better, after a few hours a big pot of soup was ready.
-   The soldiers removed the stones and enjoyed the soup with the villagers!
-   Moral of the story, if you require resources or permissions to do something better or good. Use the resources in hand and make the stone soup (mvp, or something good enough to intrigue interest) and then start asking for ingredients (not directly but indirectly) for example:- this/I could have been better if I had more xyz...

-   I learned that everyone should have a knowledge portfolio, and one should manage it just like an investment portfolio.
-   Invest something everyday and dont' put all your eggs in one basket!
