-   I learned about Pandoc, a tool for writing documents and converting them to different format using command line.
-   Thinking of making cheatsheets using it.
-   I learned how integer overflow/underflow is not just bad in general but combine it with something else, and it can be even more dangerous. For example, accessing storage slots that weren't supposed to be accessed using integer overflow/underflow. (AlienCodex challenge - Ethernaut)
