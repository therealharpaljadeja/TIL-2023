-   I learned that upgradable contracts should import upgradable contracts too, where the parent contracts use initializer functions and not constructors.
-   I learned that state variables should be initialized in initializer functions, and initializers are meant to be public but only callable once.
-   I learned that the RTL unicode character can be do a lot malicious things, it is so bad that even if the contract is verified the developer can still fool you.
