-   I learned about EVM opcodes
-   I learned that EVM is a quasi-Turing Complete Machine, meaning the halting problem is solved using gas. The halting problem says, we can't certainly say whether a program will run definitely or indefinitely before running it. So, if we run and it doesn't stop it will be a problem. EVM solves this problem by introducing gas. (I knew this before, but a revision never hurts ðŸ˜…)
-   I learned that the bytecode that is actually executed on function calls in EVM is not that one that is generated from the Solidity code we write. Instead, the code is used to generate `deployed` bytecode which becomes the data part of the contract creation transaction. The `deployed` bytecode has everything related to initialization of the contract and the `runtime` bytecode (which is actually executed on function calls/transactions)
-   I learned another trick to extract function signature from `calldata`, I previously thought that function signature was extracted by performing AND operation. Operands being the `calldata` and 0xffff... (32 bytes). However, we can perform division of `calldata` with 0x1000... (29 bytes).
-   I learned about ADD, PUSHX, SWAP, JUMPI (usually used to jump to function definitions) and many more opcodes.
-   I learned that anytime we make a call to another contract a new EVM (sandbox) is instantiation for that specific call with available gas slightly lower than (I think it is 63/64 of the previous available gas, not sure though) the parent EVM.
-   I learned that EVM global state is basically a mapping of EVM address to struct (not sure if its struct) which has address balance, address nonce (no of transaction in case of an EOA and no of contract deployed in case of a smart contract), PC (program counter) in case of smart contract, storage (nothing in case of an EOA) and environment variable like block number all this is loaded (including gas supplied via user) on every call to process the execution.
-   I learned that there is a block gas limit of 8 million as per ME book (now it is more I know, don't know the exact number. I guess 15 million), which can be increased/decreased based on votes from miners.

-   I learned how to build a custom drawer navigation in react-native.
-   I learned about `react-native-phone-number-input` and build a phone number input with country code selection.
