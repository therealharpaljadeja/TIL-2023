-   I learned that when upgrading contracts we must make sure that we define the variables in the same order as the old one first (no change in datatype, no re-positioning) and then declare the new variables in the new version.
-   This is to prevent storage collision where the slot will hold older values but might get mixed up with the new variables.
-   When writing the upgraded version the inheritence order according to the old version should also not change.
-   I learned that if a dev is unsure about requiring more space then he/she can have storage gaps like so,

```sol
contract Base {
    uint256 base1;
    uint256[49] __gap;
}

contract Child is Base {
    uint256 child;
}
```

-   I learned to set up environment for a bare react native app.
-   I learned about rn-nodeify and how it changes some node_module files to make node related modules work in react native.
