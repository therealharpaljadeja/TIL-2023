-   I learned that Ethereum's PoW algorithm is slightly different from Bitcoin's PoW, where it made sure that ASIC owner did not have a specific advantage over people mining using GPUs. In order to make it more open for participation.
-   I learned there are 2 PoS algorithm versions for Ethereum (I am not sure which one is being used in practice today). Will learn about PoS soon ðŸ˜….

-   I learned about DeepLinking in React Native. I was trying to understand how one app can trigger opening another app for a specific purpose. (Hopefully, tomorrow I will be implement connect wallet in React Native, I have done it before, trying it again ðŸ˜‚)

-   I learned to write test in Foundry, learned about Cheat Codes which let us manipulate blockchain state.
-   I learned about Anvil, Foundry built-in local blockchain.

I am solving Ethernaut problems and writing tests which basically solve the problem, [repo is here](https://github.com/therealharpaljadeja/ethernaut)
