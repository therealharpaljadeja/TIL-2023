-   I learned about EIP 1967 and how it suggests that important proxy variables should be stored, so that storage collision between Proxy and Implementation has a very low probability.
-   I learned that ownership transfer should also be a two-step process which goes as follows:
    -   First store the new owner's address in a variable
    -   Use the new owner address (be it an EOA or smart contract) and claim the owner role.
-   I learned how to read bytecode from json files in Foundry, using this we can deploy contract with compiler version different than the contracts being compiled.
