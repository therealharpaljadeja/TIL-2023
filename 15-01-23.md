-   I learned how Solidity stores dynamic arrays and mappings, how to identify short string/byte arrays (less than 32 bytes) and long arrays.
-   I learned how in Yul you can't directly write variable names to access them instead you need x.slot and x.offset, since the variable might not be occupying the entire slot.
-   I learned that external function have `address` I don't know what that means though ðŸ˜…
-   I learned that `using` keyword is not inherited in the Solidity versions, I am guessing this is to help auditors.
-   I learned about the ERC20 token extensions and utils like `Pausable`, `Burnable`, `PresetFixedSupply`, `Snapshot`, `MinterPauser` and `TokenTimelock`.
-   I learned about `Address` util from Openzeppelin, learned that we shouldn't rely on `isContract` returning true, because it returns true if
    -   a) Contract is under deployment
    -   b) Contract will be deployed in future
    -   c) Contract used to exists but now destroyed
-   I learned about the AccessControl contract by Openzeppelin, `hasRole` can be used to check if an address has a specfic role.
-   I learned about other utils like `ReentrancyGuard` and `PullPayment`.
