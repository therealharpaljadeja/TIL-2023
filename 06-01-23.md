-   I learned about block properties like stateRoot, transactionRoot and receiptRoot which are basically Keccak-256 hash of root of modified Merkle-patricia trees
-   I learned that when refunding gas to the transaction sender the gas is returned at the same gas price, I am not sure but Gas token used to work in the same manner. For example, If I send a transaction when gas price is low to get transaction confirmed and then I do a transaction when gas price is higher compared to before, to release some space on the blockchain which would mean I get some gas back then I will getting that gas back at a higher gas price, eventually making free money ðŸ˜œ.
